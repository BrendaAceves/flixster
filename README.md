### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Im unsure whether or not the lab helped prepare me to do the stretch features since I was unable to complete them, but overall I do think that the lab for this unit did help prepare me for this assignment.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have spent time attempting the stretch features and potentially add additional features such as storing user data to keep track of their favorited movies, even upon closing the website.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Overall, my project demo went well and went according to plan. Something I noticed that my peer did was placing the computer behind/to the side of them so they could focus on looking at the audience instead of their computer. This is something I would like to try next time.
